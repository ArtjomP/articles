# Changing view model state with command

The [Model-View-ViewModel Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/enterprise-application-patterns/mvvm) is a wildly used pattern among many UI  frameworks with [data binding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data-bindings-to-mvvm) support. Among them is [Avalonia](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/getting-started/programming-with-avalonia/the-model-view-viewmodel-pattern-mvvm),[MAUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui), [Uno](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/intro.html), [UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide), [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/introduction-to-wpf?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8), [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin). One of the key benefits of the MVVM pattern is making a view just a shower of properties from the view model. When view model can have many states it needs to have many methods to operate with them.
